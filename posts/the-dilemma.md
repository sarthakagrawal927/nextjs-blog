Just a test post, as I don't really have a lot of ideas on what to write. If you are reading this, I can understand how bored you are and now are probably thinking that you should leave the page. But as I have predicted this behavior, you better stick with me for the rest of the post. While writing this in VSCode, I realized that it is not a very bad place to actually write a story. 

Only thing that bums me out currently is that it gives me blue underline every word that is different in UK dictionary when compared to US dictionary. Also doing a commit every time a write a post is also pretty bad. While I am writing this I think I should shift to medium as my blog can automatically fetch the posts from medium. 

But nevertheless VSCode is kinda comforting till the point I have to add an image, though markdown file is OP , medium provides an amazing experience I can tell that by staring at its writing panel for 20 seconds. I am just writing the stuff to get myself started, maybe its not good work but its honest work. 

Writing sometimes can be so liberating, 2 minutes ago I was extremely angry at someone and now I feel so relaxed, though realising that VSCode doesn't give a grammar check I feel a bit insecure for my grammar, but I don't think you guys will find a lot of mistakes as it will have gone through MS Word, another OP software IG, though I do not have a lot of experience as I do not write a lot. 

While writing this I must tell you that it did came to my mind that the readers will be like "Damn! the way this guy writes is lit/shit." , but we will keep the praises for later posts. I remember someone saying that if you want to see drastic improvement in your life all you have to do is exercise, read and journal. Though like you (thought I should change to singular, as I assume you must be reading alone), 

I thought this is so dumb. I mean how possible reading some nice books, exercising and maintaining a record about what you do will change my life. But man I was so wrong. Exercising will keep you fit and stress free, making the brain active and many folds more efficient. Also one more thing regarding efficiency, try the pomodoro trick dude, it really works.  Then comes reading, reading is as I have found an amazing way to gain knowledge, gain new ideas and sometimes relax yourself. But then writing a journal about your day makes you feel accountable for everything you do.  You cannot overestimate the power of accountancy. Writing clears your mind, writing this post is one of the best example I can think of, it is like meditation but on steroids XD. 

All my previous anger has now faded away. Also now that I realize this looks like a big chunk of text, it looks boring to me so I should probably divide it into paragraphs add images when pasting it to medium and make it look presentable. The reason for writing this long, maybe useless, post is that writing is fun as it helps you talk to your brain and let it all out. I hope you were entertained XD. 

Thank you, Sarthak Agrawal

Now that I have pasted it on Word, it is behaving weirdly as it took its blackish background with it and is just pointing out punctuation. Word is not as great as I thought end of story.
